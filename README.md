A simple script to read the contents of a zip/tar/folder and extract metadata.

## UPDATE 2025-04-15:
Because making original names is hard, this is the final form, Arc2Lite.

## UPDATE 2025-04-14: 
With v0.0.4 this now handles ZIP and TAR and folder paths, so the script has been renamed to FileWalker (how original).

## Command Line Switches
```
usage: Arc2Lite.py [-h] input_path export_path

Arc2Lite v0.0.5 by @KevinPagano3 | @stark4n6 | https://github.com/stark4n6/Arc2Lite

positional arguments:
  input_path   Path to the ZIP/TAR file or folder for traversing
  export_path  Path for the export report

options:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
```
## To-Do
GUI maybe?
